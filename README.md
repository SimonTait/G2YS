# G2YS - GPIO 2 Yamaha SCP
Python module and web interface to command a Yamaha mixing console via SCP (Simple Control Protocol) in response to GPIO activity on a R.Pi or external i2c GPIO expander.

Intended as a way to expand the onboard GPIO pins of a Yamaha CL or QL series console.

Hasn't been tested since ~2019 - YMMV
